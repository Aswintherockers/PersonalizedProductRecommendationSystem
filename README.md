## Introduction
A Personalized Product Recommendation System is a data-driven solution that offers tailored product suggestions to users based on their individual preferences, behaviors, and historical interactions. By analyzing user data and employing sophisticated algorithms, this system enhances user engagement and drives sales by presenting users with items or content they are more likely to be interested in, ultimately improving the overall user experience.
The aim of this project is to reimagine how users engage with and discover products in the digital marketplace. By leveraging simulated user interactions, user profiling, and an advanced ranking algorithm, we create a personalized experience for users, offering them tailored product recommendations that align with their unique preferences and behaviors.

## Features

- Simulated user interactions and product data to mimic real-world scenarios.
- User profiling to define user segments and preferences.
- Advanced ranking algorithm combining collaborative and content-based filtering techniques.
- Dynamic product cards with detailed descriptions.
- Recommendations with or without the same brand for diversity.
- Evaluation metrics to measure the accuracy and relevance of rankings.
User Profiling:
Recommendation Algorithms:
 - The system creates detailed profiles for each user, considering their historical interactions, preferences, and demographics.
Real-Time Recommendations:
 - Utilizes state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms, including collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid methods.
Scalable:
